# moviesmap
This project helps people to define what 10 movies was filmed closest to the user. It also visualizes this on a map, that script is generating.
## Usage
1. Download main.py and location.list and put it in one directory. 
2. launch from the terminal main.py and specify arguments^ year, your latitude, ypur longitude
```bash
python3 main.py 2002, 49.83826, 24.02324
```
3. ???
4. Check results in map.html in your directory

You can also see your location on the map and set some of your points, doing click on the map

-----
P.S because of the restrictions of the API, I restricted amount of movies parsed in line 29. You can change that and discover closer movies
